If using the list generated by the -w/--wordlist switch with BurpSuite, then the following steps should be taken

1) Use attack type: pitchfork
2) Paste full the wordlist of “username:password" into both payload sections
3) Set a payload processing rule of “Match/Replace”. 
4) For username payload set the regex to :(.\*)
5) For password payload set the regex to this   ^[^:]+:\s*

**NB:** If passing solely the domain, do not put the '\*@' in front of it, as this may break the searches.
